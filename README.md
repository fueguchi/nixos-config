# ❄️ My nixos configuration
This is my personal NixOS configuration. 
## ⚠️ Warning
**This is a very simple configuration, it will be more elaborate as i learn nix.**

I don't know how to properly manage most programs with nix & home-manager, so things like zsh are configurated locally.

I really recommend to not just clone and rebuild your system with my config, as it is not too much modular and not multihost.
