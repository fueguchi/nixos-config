# My NixOS configuration
> [!CAUTION]
> This configuration is not meant to be used with hardware other than mine.
> Trying to deploy it to other machines without appropriate changes can render your machines unbootable and damage data.

> [!NOTE]
> Some program modules are not well configured, either due to a lack of knowledge or my current procrastination.
